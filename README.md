# PractiumII-Breast Cancer Classification 

Abstract
Creating an AI that will classify breast cancer as ether Benign or Malignant using Python language. Using Deep Learning to create an AI (Artificial Intelligence) that will build a classifier to train 80% of breast cancer histology image dataset, keeping 10% of the data for validation purposes.  Keras will be used and help define a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and naming it 'CancerNet', training the images.
